# latis-nds
Experiment with running a LaTiS server instance in NDS Labs.

This project is used to create a Docker image to be used with the *latis* NDS Labs Spec at:

```
  https://github.com/dlindhol/ndslabs-specs
```

The gradle build depends on a newer version of the code in https://github.com/dlindhol/LaTiS.
This will be rectified soon.
